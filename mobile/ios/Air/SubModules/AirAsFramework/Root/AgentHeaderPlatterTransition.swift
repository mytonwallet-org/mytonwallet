/// - a capsule on both bars is one piece of glass that changes its width and place on a spring with a slight bounce,
///   its content shrinking away and the other bar's growing in: the list's tabs and the chat's title pill, the wallet
///   avatar and the chat's more button;
/// - the chat's threads button grows out of the tabs' capsule, and collapses back into it, and so does the chat's more
///   button when the list's header has no avatar for it to turn into;
/// - every capsule that moves swells as it starts, its height a little ahead of its width, and shrinks back with a
///   bounce, a little under its size, as it lands;
/// - any other capsule on one bar only materializes or dematerializes in place.
